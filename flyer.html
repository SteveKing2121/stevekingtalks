                        <h6>The Music of the Sixties (1960-64)</h6>
                        <p>By 1960, interest in rock ‘n’ roll had started to fade, its biggest star was moving on and a
                            new generation of teenagers were seeking something different. It came in the form of the
                            Beatles, who broke all the rules and all the records. This is the story of the first five
                            years of the 1960s, one of the most creative and innovative periods in the history of music.

                        <h6>The Music of the Sixties (1965-69)</h6>
                        <p>In 1965 British music dominated the charts on both sides of the Atlantic and the Beatles were
                            blazing a trail across the world. However, in America, the civil rights and anti-war
                            movements were gaining momentum influencing a new breed of writers and musicians; electric
                            folk was born, and album sales started to increase exponentially. This is the story of the
                            second half of the sixties featuring the music of the Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Bob
                            Dylan.</p>
