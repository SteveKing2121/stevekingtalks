      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles2">The Story Behind The Song</h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        ‘Save The Last Dance For Me’ was recorded by the Drifters in 1960, with
        Ben E King on lead vocals, but what single event in the life of one of
        its writers inspired the track? Was ‘Every Breath You Take’ by the
        Police really written as a love song? What is the truth about the
        Beatles song ‘Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds’, and why did George
        Harrison stop composing for three years in 1976? We all have personal
        memories we associate with individual songs, but each song has its own
        story. In this lecture, the real stories behind some the world’s best
        known songs are revealed. This talk also works very well as an after
        dinner speech.

        The Music of the Sixties<br />
        (1960-64)
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        By 1960 interest in rock ‘n’ roll had started to fade, its biggest star
        was moving on and a new generation of teenagers were seeking something
        different. It came in the form of the Beatles, who broke all the rules
        and all the records. This is the story of the first five years of the
        1960s, one of the most creative and innovative periods in the history of
        music, featuring all the major artists, important songs and principle
        musical genres of the era.
      </p>

      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles1">
        The Music of the Sixties<br />
        (1965-69)
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        In 1965 British music dominated the charts on both sides of the Atlantic
        and the Beatles were blazing a trail across the world. However, in
        America, the civil rights and anti-war movements were gaining momentum
        influencing a new breed of writers and musicians; electric folk was
        born, and album sales started to increase exponentially. This is the
        story of the second half of the sixties featuring the music of the
        Beatles, Bob Dylan, The Bees Gees and Simon & Garfunkel.
      </p>

      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles1">When Radio Goes Wrong</h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        Steve shares some amusing stories from his own career and plays some
        very funny clips from his collection of radio bloopers from stations
        around the world. This talk is ideal as an after dinner speech.
      </p>

      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles1">
        I Guess That's Just The Way The Story Goes
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        In 1971 the singer-songwriter Don Mclean wrote ‘American Pie’ and four
        years later British band Queen released the single ‘Bohemian Rhapsody.’
        Both of these songs went on to become world-wide best sellers and are
        both considered to be defining works of the 70s - but what do they mean?
        What event inspired the Abba hit ‘The Winner Takes All’, and when Maria
        Carey took ‘Without You’ to number one in 1994, did she know the full
        story behind the song? We all know these songs, they bring back personal
        memories for many of us, but do they really mean what we think they
        mean? You may be surprised by the real stories behind some the world’s
        best known songs.
      </p>

      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles1">
        The Best Selling Songs of All Time
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        We all have our favourite songs, but which songs make the all-time best
        sellers list? Steve will reveal the top ten best selling recordings in
        history, and offer some insight into the reasons why these songs have
        become so successful.
      </p>

      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles1">
        I Bet You Think This Song Is About You?
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        It’s a famous line from a well-known 1970s hit about male vanity written
        by Carly Simon, but was it inspired by one of her lovers? Who inspired
        the Beatles classic ‘Here, There and Everywhere’, and what is the link
        between ‘Midnight Train to Georgia’ and ‘Charlie’s Angels’? Songs are
        often inspired by individuals in the lives of composers and some
        individuals have inspired more than one composer. All is not always as
        it seems - in this lecture the identities of the people who inspired
        some of the world’s best known songs are revealed.

      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles1">
        The Music of the Seventies <br />(1970-74)
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        By the end of the 1960s the UK had established itself as a world leader
        in popular music, due in no small part to the international success of
        the Beatles, and those that followed in their wake. This is the story of
        what happened next - a chronological journey through one of the most
        varied and innovative periods in the history of music. This lecture
        features the birth of Glam Rock, The Sound of California, and the music
        of The Jackson Five, T. Rex, Rod Stewart, and Elton John.
      </p>

      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles1">
        The Music of the Seventies <br />
        (1975-79)
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        The biggest selling song of 1975 in the UK was a song from the 60s by a
        band whose fans were all too young to remember the original. New teen
        sensations and disco dominated the singles chart, and album sales were
        soaring as progressive rock reached its height. The late seventies were
        set up to be the age of the superstar, but someone spoiled the party.
