      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles2">I WRITE THE SONGS</h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        “Save The Last Dance For Me” was recorded by the Drifters in 1960, but
        what single event in the life of the song’s lyricist inspired it? What
        is the truth behind the Beatles song “Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds”?
        and who is Whitney Houston’s biggest hit really about? Steve will answer
        these questions and more as he reveals the real stories behind some of
        the world’s best known songs.

        SHE LOVES YOU<br />
        The Music of the Sixties (1960-64)
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        By 1960, interest in rock ‘n’ roll had started to fade, its biggest star
        was moving on and a new generation of teenagers were seeking something
        different. It came in the form of the Beatles, who broke all the rules
        and all the records. This is the story of the first five years of the
        1960s, one of the most creative and innovative periods in the history of
        music.

        LIKE A ROLLING STONE<br />
        The Music of the Sixties (1965-69)
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        In 1965 British music dominated the charts on both sides of the Atlantic 
        and the Beatles were blazing a trail across the world. However, in America, 
        the civil rights and anti-war movements were gaining momentum influencing a n
        ew breed of writers and musicians; electric folk was born, and album sales 
        started to increase exponentially. This is the story of the second half of the 
        sixties featuring the music of the Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan.

      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles1">
        WITHOUT YOU
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        “American Pie” and “Bohemian Rhapsody” are both considered to be defining 
        songs of the seventies, but what do they mean? When Mariah Carey reached 
        number 1 in the UK for the first time, did she know the full story behind 
        the song that took her there? Steve will answer these questions and more 
        when he reveals more of these real stories behind some of the world’s best 
        known songs.                
      </p>

      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles1">
        THE BEST SELLING SONGS OF ALL TIME
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        We all have our favourite songs, but which songs make the all-time best
        sellers list? Steve will reveal the top ten best selling recordings in
        history, and offer some insight into the reasons why these songs have
        become so successful.
      </p>

      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles1">
        I BET YOU THINK THIS SONG IS ABOUT YOU
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        Songs are often inspired by individuals who come into the lives 
        of composers, but who are the people that motivated artists including 
        Neil Sedaka, the Beatles, Eric Clapton and Carly Simon to write 
        songs that have become classics?  

      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles1">
        GET IT ON <br /> The Music of the Seventies (1970-74)
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        By the end of the 1960s the UK had established itself as a world leader
        in popular music, due in no small part to the international success of
        the Beatles, and those that followed in their wake. This is the story of
        what happened next - a chronological journey through one of the most
        varied and innovative periods in the history of music.

        The Music of the Seventies (1975-79)
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        The biggest selling song of 1975 in the UK was a song from the 60s by a
        band whose fans were all too young to remember the original. New teen
        sensations and disco dominated the singles chart, and album sales were
        soaring as progressive rock reached its height. The late seventies were
        set up to be the age of the superstar, but someone spoiled the party.

        Copyright, Plagiarism and Infighting
        </h4>
        
        <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
          A closer look at music copyright and the legal disputes and creative clashes that 
          have helped shape the copyright law over the last 60 years. Featuring the stories 
          behind tracks by George Harrison, Ed Sheeran, Procol Harum and Miley Cyrus the 
          dynamics of authorship, originality, and ownership are explored. These cases reveal 
          how copyright laws impact artistic expression, how plagiarism accusations are resolved,
          and how infighting over composer credits can cause issues that remain unresolved 
          for decades.

      LAST DANCE<br />
      The Story of Disco
      </h4>
      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
       Disco music came about in part as a reaction to 1960s counterculture, and was 
       initially enjoyed by those who didn’t feel they had a voice in mainstream society. 
       However, it developed rapidly both as a genre and a subculture throughout the 1970s, 
       eventually becoming so dominant that even Rod Stewart and The Rolling Stones put 
       out Disco tracks. This is the story of how this form of dance music took the 
       world by storm, and of how three brothers born in the Isle of man found themselves 
       at its epicentre, almost by accident.

        Our members were virtually unanimous that this was an Outstanding lecture. Steve has a 
        very easy and engaging manner which belies the highly professional way in which he approaches 
        his subject. His lecture was articulate, varied and complex, paying close attention to many of 
        the key influences on popular music in the latter half of the sixties. His audio clips were 
        judiciously chosen and excellently presented, married with striking and powerful images; his 
        presentation was smooth and seamless as he guided his audience through the myriad of musical 
        movements at work. He also added significant depth to his talk by exploring the commercial, 
        cultural and social influences which were shaping the output and direction of the music. 
        The talk was lavish in both substance and style and many of our members have asked for a 
        return visit.
