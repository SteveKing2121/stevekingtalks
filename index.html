      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles2">THE STORY BEHIND THE SONG</h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        “Save The Last Dance For Me” was recorded by the Drifters in 1960, but
        what single event in the life of the song’s lyricist inspired it? What
        is the truth behind the Beatles song “Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds”?
        and who is Whitney Houston’s biggest hit really about? Steve will answer
        these questions and more as he reveals the real stories behind some of
        the world’s best known songs.

        SHE LOVES YOU<br />
        The Music of the Sixties (1960-63)
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        By 1960, interest in rock ‘n’ roll had started to fade, its biggest star
        was moving on. A new generation of teenagers were seeking something
        different; it came in the form of the Beatles, who broke all the rules
        and all the records. This is the story of the first four years of the
        1960s, one of the most creative and innovative periods in the history of
        music.
      </p>

      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles1">
        LIKE A ROLLING STONE<br />
        The Music of the Sixties (1964-66)
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        In the middle years of the sixties, the Beatles conquered America with
        the help of a 14-year-old girl. They were then followed by a stream of
        acts from the UK in what became known as the British Invasion.
        Initially, the US record industry didn’t know how to respond, until one
        of the most influential bands of the era launched a new genre.
      </p>
      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles1">
        THOSE WERE THE DAYS<br />The Music of the Sixties (1967-69)
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        The final years of the sixties brought The Summer of Love, the world’s
        first boy band and the return of The King. Pop was growing up, rock was
        splitting up, and both the 7-inch single and the lead singer found
        themselves with rivals. There was just enough time to reflect, then
        suddenly it was over.
      </p>

      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles1">WHEN RADIO GOES WRONG</h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        Steve shares some amusing stories from his own career and plays some
        very funny clips from his collection of radio bloopers from stations
        around the world. This talk is ideal as an after dinner speech.
      </p>

      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles1">
        I GUESS THAT'S JUST THE WAY THE STORY GOES
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        In 1971 the singer-songwriter Don Mclean wrote "American Pie" and four
        years later British band Queen released the single "Bohemian Rhapsody."
        Both of these songs went on to become worldwide best sellers and are
        both considered to be defining works of the 70s - but what do they mean?
        What event inspired the Abba hit ‘The Winner Takes It All’, and when
        Maria Carey took "Without You" to number one in 1994, did she know the
        full story behind the song? We all know these songs, they bring back
        personal memories for many of us, but do they really mean what we think
        they mean? You may be surprised by the real stories behind some the
        world’s best known songs.
      </p>

      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles1">
        THE BEST SELLING SONGS OF ALL TIME
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        We all have our favourite songs, but which songs make the all-time best
        sellers list? Steve will reveal the top ten best selling recordings in
        history, and offers some insight into the reasons why these songs have
        become so successful.
      </p>

      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles1">
        I BEST YOU THINK THIS SONG IS ABOUT YOU
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        It’s a famous line from a well-known 1970s hit about male vanity written
        by Carly Simon, but was it inspired by one of her lovers? Who inspired
        the Beatles classic "Here, There and Everywhere", and what is the link
        between "Midnight Train to Georgia" and "Charlie’s Angels"? Songs are
        often inspired by individuals in the lives of composers and some
        individuals have inspired more than one composer. All is not always as
        it seems - in this lecture the identities of the people who inspired
        some of the world’s best known songs are revealed.

      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles1">
        THE MUISC OF THE SEVENTIES <br />(1970-74)
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        By the end of the 1960s the UK had established itself as a world leader
        in popular music, due in no small part to the international success of
        the Beatles, and those that followed in their wake. This is the story of
        what happened next - a chronological journey through one of the most
        varied and innovative periods in the history of music. This lecture
        features the birth of Glam Rock, The Sound of California, and the music
        of The Jackson Five, T. Rex, Rod Stewart, and Elton John.

      <h4 data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="titles1">
        THE MUISC OF THE SEVENTIES <br />
        (1975-79)
      </h4>

      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
        The biggest selling song of 1975 in the UK was a song from the 60s by a
        band whose fans were all too young to remember the original. New teen
        sensations and disco dominated the singles chart, and album sales were
        soaring as progressive rock reached its height. The late seventies were
        set up to be the age of the superstar, but someone spoiled the party.
